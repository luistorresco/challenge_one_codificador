# Alura Latam Project: Text Encryptor and Decryptor

This project was developed as part of the Alura Latam course, where I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project is to create a web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text, as well as provide a function to copy the result.

## Features

- **Encryption and Decryption**: The application allows users to enter text and encrypt it using a specific algorithm. It also allows input of encrypted text for decryption.

- **Copy Text Function**: A feature is included that allows users to copy the encrypted or decrypted text to their clipboard with a single click.

## Design and Colors

The design and colors used in this application were suggested by Alura as part of the course challenge, following a modern and attractive aesthetic.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the application:
